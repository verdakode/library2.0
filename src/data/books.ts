To be capable of observing, analyzing, and changing our environments such that new systems can exist as a direct result of our reasoning feels like a bug.
Nowhere else is this present in nature to the extent at which we exhibit this.
Does this mean that we are meant to be beings of entropy and creation?
Our lifespans limit our ability to naturally evolve our systems and our lossy documentation is really the only way of passing information.
Back to my original question, the only way I have found to methodically approach any kind of "purpose" is looking at all the things I am capable of and wondering why exactly I am.
This has lead me to some interesting questions that I will explore another time when it is not 1 am.`,

 hi! i'm verda!

 for all intents and purposes, i am a instance of the universe. going a bit deeper than that, I am a temple of flesh predicted by my brain which in turn was predicted by someone elses brain.
 so here are a few facts about things that I think influence and inform my opinions, ideas, and actions
 - i was legally blind (-5.5) until my parents realized (when I was 10) that i needed glasses. i learned to read when I was 2 because I could only see very close up.
 - i was homeschooled in the IFB church until the 5th grade, big fan of the KJV bible. i've bounced between public school, catholic private school, and a shortlived attempt at a mechatronics degree at a community college.
 - i made my first website in high school, it was a library website! after that I got my first software engineer job at a software consultancy called the pesto group at 17 (why I did not go to college) and maybe even what lead me to move to sf. i have since built 3d printers with general fabrication, contracted with k-scale labs, started a garage factory website https://makermesh.org, do a variety of sidequests
 - when i am writing this, i live at a san francisco hacker house i started called prototype sf. which you can read about online as https://prototypesf.org

on my first day of school, I was 10 years old. my only objective was finding book-like kindred spirits (see anne and diane from green gables/nancy and detective friends).
alas, this was not to be. only after two years, i made two good friends who attended a school across the town from me. one day i was embarrassed because
they could do cartwheels and I could not. i resolved to cartwheel, round-off, back 
and front walkover and do right, left, and middle splits.
this incurred the wrath of my overstretched father who exclaimed in outrage at the sight of
a brown dirt patch in his otherwise luscious long green grass. however, i think it made him proud. he has often cited "the time i wore a hole in the
grass learning to cartwheel" as evidence of tenacity.
i really enjoyed spanish class because to learn was to speak.
in an otherwise sterile and silent school day of passive consumption, it was refreshing.
after learning 3d modeling, i began an engineering club in middle school. we designed things with tinkercad and 3d printed them.
i ended up 3d printed a lot of fidget spinners, selling them to people.

      content: `# how to structure seconds, minutes, hours, days, years, and decades
      our brains are continuously performing active inference, continuously updating our internal models of the world in order to seek out the next tidbit of information needed to continue updating and leveling up. this is known as the free energy principle. where systems evolve over time by minimizing a quantity known as "free energy" to reduce surprise or uncertainty. The FEP is theorized to apply to all timescales, from milliseconds of perception, to evolutionary timescales. i theorize that optimizing your life for reducing uncertainty or surprise is very useful in many ways. therefore I structure my days as follows.
      - 6-7am wake up, waking up early allows you more time conscious than the rest of the world, giving you a head start on perception and that good old internal model
      - 6/7-8 water, stretch, maybe walk, breakfast, check messages, probably drink caffiene
      - 8-lunch, slowly work into the daily rhythm of maintaining various projects and relationships
      - lunch, this should usually happen with other humans, ideally you spend most of the day around other humans
      - rest of day until bed, varies between working and admin tasks. eat a healthy dinner, get exercise if not had yet.
      - bed, 10/11pm, wind down by reading/writing/stretching or planning for early morning tasks next day

      - all of this is purposefully very flexible as to allow me to deal with the inevitably most important thing that must be done each day in service of *the arc*
      - time is a projection of the mind, treat it as such, there is only the present and you have access to your optimal policy at all times. identifying high leverage actions is key.
      - oft, a sense of urgency is that which clouds the mind

- Russ Taber
   at a library in grand rapids for the first area wide 3d printing meetup, i immediately noticed the tubing
   he was carrying and proceeded to pepper him with questions. upon further investigation, he was in the process
   of creating a ceremic 3d printer. after discussing the danger klipper installations and various ceremic flow
   rate issues, he showed me pictures of all the 3d printers he had and a flower lamp he designed. he ended up
   giving me a kit to put together the flower lamp and he has been my favorite grand rapids friend since. if you are curious,
   you can find him at idig3d.com or on any social media @idig3d.
- Rayleeana Hayward
   my first online -> real friend. after a long discussion on musically.com
   we discovered we lived nearby and proceeded to meet at a bagel shop nearby to discuss various schemes
  regarding the opposite gender.

   met at a run club in Grand Rapids, MI, inventor of transpapers, triathlete, and a very good friend.
   most notably has a very good sense of humor. took me on a 30 mile bike ride where i rode a walkmart bike
   and they patiently rode slowly,
- Kevin Knack
   my middle school science teacher, got me my first 3d printer and taught me tinkercad. also was the advisor
   for my first engineering club.
- Aaron Venema
   coworker from my first software engineer job. lived in china for a while, picked up ruby on rails very
   thoroughly very fast. background in civil engineering. went on an insane month long bike ride. is
   the creator of very intricate gaming systems.
- Gabriella Rice
   running best friend. straight forward no bullshit asian woman. my adult inspiration and motivator to run
